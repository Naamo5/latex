\chapter{Introduction}


Somewhat big picture describing where the work fits in. How far to zoom out depends on the topic. It should be one or two levels of abstraction up. Does not have to be all the way to “drones are important…”

Describe what the problem you study is using words that one can understand without having read the thesis first. It is good if this ends in a very explicit problem statement.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Logistic robots increase in number in warehouse: 69,000 logistic systems were installed in 2017, 162 \% more than in 2016 (26,294) accounting for 63 \% of the total units and 36 \% of the total sales (in value) of professional service robots \cite{industrialRobot2018}.
	\item Interesting for economics, productivity reasons
\end{itemize}
